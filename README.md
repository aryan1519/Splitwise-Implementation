# Splitwise-Implementation

This contains code for the implementaiton of splitwise's no. of transactions reduction algorithm.

The code is in C++ and used multisets.

The user has to input the total number of transactions.

Then enter each transaction. Example Aryan John 100   (which means Aryan has to pay 100 to John).

The algorithm reduces the number of transactions and displays the final neccessary transactions.

The program currently runs in the terminal.

### TO DO

* Make a GUI for this.

* Make a graphical representation of the transactions and the simplifiction of that.
